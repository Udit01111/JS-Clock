# JavaScript Clock Project

A minimalist and functional clock application built with JavaScript. This project demonstrates my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS by implementing a dynamic clock that updates in real-time.

## Features

- Displays the current time (hours, minutes, seconds) in real-time.
- A clean and responsive user interface.
- Lightweight and fast, deployed using Vercel.

## Deployment

The project is live and accessible here: [JavaScript Clock on Vercel](https://js-clock-psi.vercel.app/)
